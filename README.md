# Predicting-the-net-hourly-electrical-energy
We have used 
1. Linear regression
2. Ridge regression
3. Lasso regression and 
4. Elastic net regression 

to predict the net hourly electrical energy output of a combined cycle power plant. The source code contains preliminary data analysis. A brief report is available in report.pptx file. 

The markdown file was also uploaded to Rpubs: https://rpubs.com/Tesfahun_Boshe/predictionRegression 

To replicate the work:
* clone the repository to your local machine
* set the working directory to the folder: *Predicting-the-net-hourly-electrical-energy*
* run the *Prediction_by_regression.Rmd* file on RStudio.
